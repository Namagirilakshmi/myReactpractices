    <h1>Dinosaur</h1>
    <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that
    first appeared during the Triassic period. Although the exact origin and
    timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research,[1]
    the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243
    million years ago.[2] They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates
    after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their
    dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended
    when the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most
     dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.</p>
